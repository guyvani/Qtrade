Project Goal: creare a quantitative trading engine

Updates: Due to issues with yahoo finance 
         pandas_datareader module failed and since google
	 does not allow to download certain sylbol data
	 like S&P 500 :INX, we had to look for fix of 
	 pandas_datareader to talk to yahoo finance.
	 this fix is in fix-yahoo-finance module
	 and all the files and how to use this fix are included
         in example files here.
	 Examples on how to Download stock data and save it then read it back
	 from either Yahoo or Google Finance is also here.
